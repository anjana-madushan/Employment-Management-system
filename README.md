Instructions to run the web application

Open Project using an IDE.
Open two terminals for the backend and front end.
And install all the dependencies of the backend and frontend by giving npm install or npm i for both terminals.
Run the backend using one of the commands(npm run dev/ npm start)
Run frontend using Npm run dev command

Since I have used Vite to create react app it will not automatically open in frontend. 
Browse this URL to open the application in the browser (http://127.0.0.1:5173/)
frontend PORT = 5173
backend PORT = 5000

All the main requirements are completed in the application.
